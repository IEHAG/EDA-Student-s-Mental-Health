# üß† Exploring Students' Mental Health: An In-Depth Analysis üìä

Welcome to the **EDA-Student-s-Mental-Health** repository! This repository houses my first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that delves into the intricate world of **Students' Mental Health**. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into various factors that impact students' mental well-being.

## About the Project
In this project, we have utilized Jupyter Notebook to perform in-depth EDA on the dataset "Students Mental Health". By employing powerful tools like `pandas`, `Python`, and `SciPy`, we have conducted statistical analyses, visualizations, and hypothesis testing to uncover valuable information about student mental health.
